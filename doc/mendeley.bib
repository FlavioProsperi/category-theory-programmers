@misc{MacLane1998,
abstract = {Categories for the Working Mathematician provides an array of general ideas useful in a wide variety of fields. Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality. The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits. These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors. The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem. After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions. This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest. One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them. The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence. The bibliography has also been expanded to cover some of the many other recent advances concerning categories.},

@article{Barr1998,
abstract = {This book is a textbook in basic category theory, written specifically to be read by researchers and students in computing science. The authors expound the constructions basic to category theory in the context of examples and applications to computing science. Some categorical ideas and constructions are already used heavily in computing sciences and many of these use are described. Other ideas, in particular the concept of adjoint have not appeared as widely in the computing science literature. The authors give an elementary exposition of those ideas they believe to be basic categorical tools, with pointers to possible application. Michael Barr is Peter Redpath Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. Charles Wells is Professor of Mathematics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. This new edition contains all the material from the first and second editions, including the four chapters excised from the second edition and the solutions to all the exercises, as well as added material on factorization systems, monoidal categories, and other topics. All errors known to the authors have been corrected.},
